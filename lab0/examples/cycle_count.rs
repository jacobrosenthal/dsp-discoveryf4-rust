//! This project is used to measure the code execution in terms of clock cycles.
//!
//! Requires `cargo install probe-run`
//!
//! probe-run builds, uploads, and runs your code on device and in combination
//! with rtt-target and panic-probe prints debug and panic information to your
//! console. Its used for short running sessions like seeing the results of a
//! calculation or a measurement, a panic message or backtrace of an error right
//! on your command line. It exits when it detects a breakpoint.
//!
//!`cargo run --release --example cycle_count`
